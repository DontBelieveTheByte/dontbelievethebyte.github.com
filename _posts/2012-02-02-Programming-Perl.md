![Programming perl](/assets/img/reviews/programming-perl.jpg)

I found this book in the trash near my apartment, I picked it up thinking it has tremendous value but I found it
hard to read. I'm not an advanced Perl programmer, not even intermediate. 

It's rather nice that Larry Wall himself, I have to admire the devotion from the creator of Perl himself and who better
 explain than him? 

Perl isn't going anywhere but The language is on the decline and outside of the occasional shell script for system
administration or hacking a quick command line utility, I will probably never have to work or maintain a large Perl project.

Perl missing the OOP boat by a long shot, like PHP's OOP, it's an afterthought but the topic is not even covered in the book.

I'm not sure if the book is a reference, a cookbook or a manual but it seemed rather disorganized, covering a wide range of 
topics. A strong point is how it tries to address the idiosyncrasies of Perl and what makes it special.

[TMTOWTDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it) is probably what I appreciate the most in Perl 
and this book doesn't disappoint for a second in that regard. That being said, it also shows that the obvious way to do
things in a classic mannerâ„¢ is often the longest way to achieve an objective in Perl. If there's one things this book 
tries to accomplish, it's trying to make you think in Perl.

The information presented is often very dense and I'm not if I'm able to appreciate the nature of the book at the moment.
It's often true that easy things are easy in Perl compared to other language there's little boilerplate but hard things 
also seem hard. I guess reading this book and doing Perl is like learning to play the piano, you have to stick to it for
years until it finally pays off.

The part I appreciate the most, what the bridge between perl and system administration because that's what's most relevant
to me since my beginning with Perl.

I think it's great addition to [Learning perl](/review/2011/08/25/learing-perl/) and the two must probable go together
and are must haves for a Perl programmer. That being said, I will probably not read it again.
