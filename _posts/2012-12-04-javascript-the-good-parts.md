![JavaScript: The Good Parts](/assets/img/reviews/javascript-the-good-parts.jpg)

###Overview
There are a few challenges and criticism when it comes to writing decent JavaScript code. Outside of the valid reasons
to complain like the incoherent type system, the root of most of the problems is often trying to turn JavaScript into
another language by using it as such or using the bad parts like the historically bad GOTO.

This pamphlet proposes a subset of JavaScript to those who are already familiar with the language and it promises to make
your life easier when both having to write and maintain JavaScript code.

###Eradicating confusion
It starts by trying to get the main confusions about the language out of the way. I don't often see that many railroad
diagrams but they proven helpful to that extent.

There are insights into what makes Javascript so confusing and what can be done about it since there seems to be many ways
to accomplish the same thing while some of the parts seem incoherent and he addresses all of these issues from talking
about his own experience.

###What you should do
The author cycles through what he thinks are the good parts and provides examples on how to use them. They are concise
and self-explanatory with code examples often accompanied by diagrams.

The programming style proposed in this book is different then most of what is proposed in other books. For one, it
throws away the pseudo-classical to favour of the prototypical inheritance style that JavaScript can readily leverage using
different patterns then the classical inheritance ones we're often more accustomed to when we think about OOP.

In other words, it makes you think about object creation in a different manner that you're accustomed to in order to be
a more effective JavaScript programmer.

###What you should avoid

When reading the appendix, you get to learn about the awful and the bad parts of JavaScript which are the portions of
the language that you should especially avoid. At least, there are reasons provided as to why you should avoid them so
you can decide for yourself if his arguments are convincing enough for you to start changing your coding style or not.

###Conclusion
I would definitely read this book again and I have! It's also a nice addition to The Definitive Guide.

###More!

Crockford works at Yahoo, YUI Theater put out a few series that turned out to be very interesting while covering everything
in this book and even more.

There also an excellent series on Youtube covering many things from the history of the language and how it came to be
what is is today
