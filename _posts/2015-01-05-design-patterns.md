## Overview

This books is a classic that doesn't need much of an introduction. 

The book's examples are written mostly in C++ and Smalltalk. You don't have to be a wizard in any of the those two languages as long as
you're comfortable with at least one object oriented language. 

C++ is still going strong while the often forgotten Smalltalk has principles and syntax that are close enough to Apple's Objective-C.

I was still a fledgling developer at the time I attempted to first read this book. 
My initial impression was that it was outdated and dry. 
But as the months and projects went by, I began to understand the importance of patterns in general and this remarkable text in particular.
Indeed, without much experience in the field, one might find this book too theoretical, or even irrelevant to practical work. 
But one day, you'll find yourself faced with a particularly nasty problem, and all of the sudden a pattern will flash in your mind, and click! 
The connection is made, and the problem is solved.
It was very gratifying for me to experience this feeling over and over again; as I'm sure it would be for any junior 
developer just getting his feet wet.
Two words of advice come to mind, though: First, please keep in mind that the patterns herein are not the only ones out there;
there are many others documented in various other books and articles. Second, be very careful of the Singleton pattern;
it is the most overused and abused of the patterns, simply because it is easy to implement. 
And note that the text says nothing about the destruction of a Singleton, so watch out.
It is my opinion that this book should become mandatory reading for all software developers of all levels, and the
patterns within it should be as common a construct as an "if" statement or a "for" loop. Please, do yourself and your 
profession a favor and read this book.

From all other people's reviews, you have already known this is the classic text on the subject of design patterns. 
This is indisputable so I don't need to waste time trying to prove it again.
However, I would like to say something to those readers who are totally new to design patterns and C++/Smalltalk -- 
please do not be intimidated by the seemingly terse, dry and difficult style of this book. 
Since I myself am new to the world of design patterns, I would like to share with you my own experience and hope you can
make a better decision when you pick your design patterns book.

"Design Patterns" is the classic text; its style is academic-oriented, rigorous, and terse. Unlike most popular computer books, 
you will find reading this book takes a lot of thinking, for each paragraph or even each sentence. Most examples used in
this book are adapted from real world systems popular many years ago, so you will likely find you're not familiar with
them at all. Moreover, some examples are related to GUI programming, so if you're mainly programming for backend, you 
will probably feel it's tough to understand some of the examples. Most code example in the book is written in C++ (some in Smalltalk.)
If you're a Java programmer and have limited knowledge in C++, it might take you some time to guess what certain C++ syntax means.
These all seem to be negative comment, but my conclusion is to the contrary -- this is the BEST book in the area, and 
you should read it despite of all the issues I mentioned above. I started my design pattern learning by using a couple
of other books, such as "Java Design Patterns: A Tutorial", "Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on
Object-Oriented Design", and "Applied Java Patterns". I chose these books mainly because they seem to be much easier 
to understand than "Design Patterns". However, after spending time in these alternative books, I found none of them 
offers the accuracy and depth as "Design Patterns". Often, after I read a chapter of the "easy" book, I feel I am still
kind of lost. I seem to have understood the pattern I just learned, but then I feel it's not quite so. I guess I only 
learned the pattern in a superficial way, with little depth, and without being part of "big picture." Later, I turned 
to the classic, "Design Patterns". I forced myself to sit down and try to understand the authors' terse and rigorous 
writing and their unfamiliar examples. Gradually I found I was getting used to the style and the examples, and I 
actually started to learn much more from this book than from others. After reading half-way through the book, I felt
the rigorous style is actually a big plus for this book, because I can get more accurate and in-depth information.
Therefore, I strongly suggest that you buy and read this book, even if you feel it's difficult to read. 
Your effort will pay off eventually. Use other books as reference only.
