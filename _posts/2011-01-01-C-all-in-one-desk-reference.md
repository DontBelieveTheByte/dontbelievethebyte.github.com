Coming from a Perl background, this book turned out to be useful for learning out the basics of C programming.

The book wasn't operating system specific so it was nice to be able to run the examples quickly since installing GCC is
pretty trivial in Linux.

This is an introduction to lower level memory stuff without going to deep.

The book is a nice complement to the K&R classic but it goes a little deeper in other directions like explaining the
implementation of some of the most used data structures such as the array, multidimensional arrays, linked list, double linked list, etc.

From the pure thickness of the book, you end up covering quite a lot in the end although you will not be able to make
any serious bigger programs using the knowledge provided.
