![C All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies](/assets/img/reviews/c-all-in-one.jpg)

Coming from a Perl background as my first language,
this book turned out to be useful for learning out the basics of C programming.

There's the obvious introduction to syntax and looping.

But also, while learning C programming, it also teaches you about memory management by default which is a good thing since
it demystifies string operations.

There's a nice chapter that introduces you to the world of memory addresses, pointers and how they interact.

I was a bit apprehensive at first since this a Dummies book but a strong point from the start is that the book isn't operating system specific.
It was nice to be able to get going quickly, type out and compile the examples right away since installing GCC is a breeze on any Linux distribution.

There is also a valid and informative introduction to lower level memory stuff by making it very accessible and
easy to understand but at the cost of never really going to deep in the subject.

The book is a nice complement to the K&R classic that I have read later but it goes a little deeper in other directions you might
not expect, like explaining and illustrating the implementation of some of the most used data structures such as
unidimensional and multidimensional arrays, linked list, double linked list, etc.

From the pure thickness of the book, you end up covering quite a lot in the end, although you will not be able to create
any serious bigger programs using the sole knowledge provided.
