### Overview

I'm having a major interest in Drupal at the moment, it seems one of the most powerful CMS out there so I thought this 
book was a must have.

### Content

The book is well organized as long as you know what you're looking for and does a decent job a demystifying Drupal specific
jargon.

If covers and explains in details different part of the rendering process from bootstrapping to the final stage and walks 
you through the most important steps of implementing commonly used features from overriding themes, to defining menus to 
more complicated topics like defining and managing database schemas when building or upgrading custom modules.

I started using Drupal with version 6 and it wasn't always clear what's changed from the previous version and what I should 
be looking out for, what's left out and what's new, it's mostly up to you to find out after a bit of frustration since 
having to juggle between a D6 and D7 at the same time can get your head spinning pretty fast at times.

### Verdict

Although there are plenty of diagrams, screenshots and lots of code examples, I'm not sure if this book is worth buying,
online documentation from the official and non official source has been shown to be more complete and effective at finding 
solutions to the problems I had.
