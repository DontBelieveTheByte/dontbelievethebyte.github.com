###Overview
I'm having a major interest in Drupal as it seems one of the most powerful CMS out there, I thought this book was a must have.

The book is well organized as long as you know what you're looking for and does a decent job a demystifying Drupal specific
jargon.

If often explains in details and walks you through the most important steps of implementing commonly used features from overriding themes,
to defining menus to more complicated topics like defining and managing database schemas when building or upgrading custom modules.

I started using Drupal with version 6, it wasn't always clear what's changed, what's left out and what's new, it's mostly up
to you to find out. Having to juggle between a D6 and D7 at the same time can get your head spinning pretty fast at times.

Although there are plenty of diagrams, screenshots and lots of code examples, I'm not sure if this book is worth buying,
online documentation from the official and non official source has been shown to be more complete and effective at finding solutions to the problems I had.
