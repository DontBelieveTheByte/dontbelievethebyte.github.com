![Curvy to fat](/assets/curvy_to_fat/icon-128.png?raw=true "Curvy To Fat")

### Overview

Derived from the work of Steven Frank's [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) Chrome extension.

It's a Chrome and also a Firefox extension that replaces occurrences of 'curvy' with 'fat' and 'fat' with 'honest'.

There's also a Safari version in the making.

Outside of the different use case from Cloud To Butt, I made a few improvements which I will soon send as a pull request:

*   Changes the page title
*   Works with AJAX content
*   Better Regex
*   Added an icon
