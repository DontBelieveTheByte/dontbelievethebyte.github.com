## Overview

I'm serious about programming and I'm actively looking for ways to become a better programmer. I can safely say that this 
book made me a better programmer and this is just the beginning.


###What I got out of it

I honestly wish I had found this book earlier. I feel this is a game changed and it's probably one of the best investment 
I have made so far.

The examples are all in Java which was a nice addition since I was mainly coding in that particular language at the time 
I was reading the book.

It has a very practical standpoint, not only to you get to see code that from real software in use by a lot of people, 
you get to see the code pulled apart and refactored in a much better manner. To be honest, my own code is often more terrible 
than the version he was starting out with, so it's a big step to see what can be done even with what's already 
considered good code.

The author isn't pretentious about his craft, he makes a good judgement call that peer review is an accepted process in just 
about any profession and software development shouldn't be an exception to this since in the end, we all benefit from it.

### Topics

The book covers a wide range of topics, from the things that are downright often overlooked like the way you name things, 
when and what to comment, proving that most of the time commenting is a failure to express yourself in code when you should just 
be writing self-documenting code that reads like a story.

It's easy for the author to demonstrate what constitutes bad code, you may recognize some of the things you do but it's comforting 
that he also gives you the remedies.

It also makes you think about how to organize your components, what constitutes a function, how big a class should be, etc.

Classic principles of good object oriented programming are showcased not in an abstract ideals but demonstrated with clear examples.

Many principles illustrated in the book are things you would seldom think about until it has been shown to you, like mixing 
different levels of abstraction, it's part of our nature, of how we speak but it's far from ideal when organizing logical concept 
in a program.

You also learn about ways to handle errors more nicely, what you should do with exceptions and when you should throw them to indicate 
failure instead of relying on error code or null return values.

It also opened my eyes as to why I should get into TDD (Test Driven Development), this is the next thing I'll be adding to 
my toolbox. I feel ashamed that I have not taken more interest in TDD so far.

The author also discusses larger aspects of the system itself and the challenges that come with concurrent programming.

You get to see the code from the standpoint of a maintainer, which is often overlooked when you're reading online tutorials 
that are hacked away for the purpose of demonstrating a single principle. You get to see the iterative process of making code 
cleaner. Sometimes, the chapters are long since the task isn't easy, there's a lot of back and forth just like real world 
coding but they are worth sticking through until the end.

The propositions feel like they are part of th modern programming world we see today, like you can apply them right away and 
that they would make your code better right away. 

The chapter about code smells and heuristic is a nice way to summarize the whole book, it keeps things fresh.

### Conclusion

I have learned to take pride in my code and the work I produce and be more meticulous if not pedantic about small details 
that make the most difference, my ego is not attached to a particular judgement call but it's nice knowing how to make my 
life easier for myself and others since I'm involved in open source.

Another things that really caught onto me is that software development is a never ending process. It doesn't matter how 
good you think your code is, it can still be improved. I now try to leave the place cleaner everywhere I visit, every line I 
touch, there's often something that can be made.

I can barely wait to read this book again and after I'm done, I'll be reading the sequel The Clean Coder: A Code of 
Conduct for Professional Programmers which expands even more on the same topics.
