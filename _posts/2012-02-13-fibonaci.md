###The Golden Ratio and The Fibonacci Sequence

Ah the Golden Ratio.

So much has been said about it already but don't worry if you don't know anything about it as everything will be clear 
at the end of this article. 

Although it is a pretty cool number and it has close ties to the Fibonacci sequence, it would 
not be rational (get it?) to assume that everything we hear about it is true.

Just yesterday, after feeling inspired about the pervasive presence of this number all around us, I stumbled upon this 
Youtube video from the Museum of Mathematics which, I must admit, cleared a lot of things about the subject, not only is it 
interesting, it's also accessible and easy to understand.

As you can see from the video, it is often easier to mold reality to our custom beliefs than it is to mold our beliefs to the objective 
reality. The inquisitive eye of the skeptic mind must always keep this thought at the forefront of its awareness.

### Beauty in mathematics

Also, even though the Golden Ratio human body proportions sometimes looks sketchy from what we have seen in the previous 
video, there's a patent for beauty facial recognition using this principle (actually, I lied there is more than one patent).

There is this mask coming from the same patent holders.

The theory behind it is that the more aesthetically pleasing individuals features tend to correlate those features more closely as 
you align the fractal grid-mask on top of the face.

If you have minimal Photoshop or GIMP skills, it may be easy to check yourself out or just check out someone you know and 
how they align to the perfect beauty template by overlaying it on top. 

All you have to know is that the one on the left represents the idealized female and the other one represents the idealized male.

### Screens

There is also this story about computers and TV screens.

While it has been said in the video that we have no universal preference for a perfect rectangle, we tend to prefer the 
wider view area over the old one that looks more squared, probably because we have a naturally wide viewing angle that is 
close to 180 degrees even if our focal point is very narrow.

So the truth is that those widescreen HDTVs may match more closely our own human stereoscopic vision then our actual 
personal and cultural aesthetic preferences but how do we differentiate them from one another?

</div>

<div style="background-color: red; border: 1px solid #000; height: 200px; width: 356px;">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<b style="background-color: red; font-size: x-large;">16:9 (1.78:1)</b></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Most common aspect ratio for computer displays</b></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>HD video standard</b></span></div>
</div>



You may have noticed that the screen with the aspect ratio that is closer to the aspect to the Golden Ratio 1.6180 is 
actually 16:10. You might want to keep that in mind next time you go shopping for a gadget or an electronic device or maybe not.

Finally, here is a Perl Script that I made that will calculate the Fibonacci sequence for you until your computer does not want to give you any more free memory to work for you.
All you have to do is change the $iterate variable on line 6 to have number of iteration you desire.

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use bignum;

    my $iterate = 100; ##Change that number if you want more iterations
    my $iteration = 1;
    my $first = 1;
    my $second =1;

    while ($iteration < $iterate){
      my $answer = $first + $second;
      print ("$first + $second = $answer \n");
      $first = $second;
      $second = $answer;
      $iteration++;
    }

A typical output for 20 iterations of going through the Fibonacci sequence would look like this :

    $ ./fibonaci.pl
    1 + 1 = 2
    1 + 2 = 3
    2 + 3 = 5
    3 + 5 = 8
    5 + 8 = 13
    8 + 13 = 21
    13 + 21 = 34
    21 + 34 = 55
    34 + 55 = 89
    55 + 89 = 144
    89 + 144 = 233
    144 + 233 = 377
    233 + 377 = 610
    377 + 610 = 987
    610 + 987 = 1597
    987 + 1597 = 2584
    1597 + 2584 = 4181
    2584 + 4181 = 6765
    4181 + 6765 = 10946
    6765 + 10946 = 17711
