This review will be straight to the point just like the book was.

It's proclaimed to be a classic, I must admit that I read it only because I heard it was a masterpiece and sets the
standard as to what a programming manual should look like.

I think reading it is still useful since the C language hasn't changed that much and remains powerful throughout the
years. I may do system programming or be a kernel hacker, but C is relevant to me when playing with an arduino.

The book provides a clear, concise understanding of how to program in the C language should be and is organized in a
very logical manner without making you feel dumb or infantilized by going on useless ramblings that have little to do
with the topic at hand. It also gives valuables insights on good coding practices for programmers of all levels.
