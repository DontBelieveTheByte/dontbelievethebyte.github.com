![K&R - The C Programming Language](/assets/img/reviews/K&R-The-C-Programming-Language.png)

### Overview

This review will be straight to the point just like the book was.

It's proclaimed to be a classic, I must admit that I read it only because I have through the grapevine that it was a 
masterpiece and sets the standard as to what a programming manual should look like.

### Content

The book provides a clear and concise understanding of how to program in the C language.
 
It is also organized in a very logical manner without making you feel dumb or infantilized by avoiding to go on useless ramblings 
that have little to do with the topic at hand unlike other programming manuals. 

It also gives valuables insights on good coding practices for programmers of all levels.

### Verdict

I think reading it is still useful since the C language hasn't changed that much and remains powerful throughout the
years. 

I may not do system programming or be a kernel hacker, but C is relevant to me when playing with an arduino or thinking 
about lower level stuff when I'm coding in PHP.
