![Learning Perl, 6th Edition](/assets/img/reviews/learning-perl.jpg)


This isn't the first Perl book that I read but I feel a bit rusty and at the same time I want to pick up the language
again there's a new 6th edition of Learning Perl that just came out.

Perl 5.14 just was just released and the book is also update to a classic text in the Perl world. I'm not sure you
would benefit from a newer edition if you happen to have an older one but if you have a choice to make I guess this is it.

The book takes a bottom up approach, it covers the basics about the syntax and gives enough information for you to start writing basic scripts
that are useful for manipulating text or administering a system while at the same time not really teaching you about programming in general.

The examples shown in order to teach concepts are fairly straightforward and clear enough to understand.
Each chapter ends with an exercise in order to help you consolidate or push the boundaries of your knowledge by using
the building blocks from the concepts thought on the previous pages.

This is indeed a good book for a beginner with no programming experience at all or someone wanting to grasp the basics of
the language.
