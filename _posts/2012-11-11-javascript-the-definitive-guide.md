### Overview
I wanted to learn JavaScript in depth not because I liked it, but because of it's pervasiveness. Douglas Crockford
made a convincing case the JavaScript needs to be taken seriously. The Good Parts are not enough in my opinion, it's a
subset you can use personally but in the wild, you might encounter much much more.

At a whopping 1078 pages, the book aims to cover everything, and it mostly does.

### First section
In the first part, the whole syntax is covered in much details along with examples and techniques on how to use each
parts of the language all clearly expressed in a very logical order, this is one of the perks you get from reading a
book instead of putting together pieces from posts on stackoverflow. The author also shows many ways to accomplish the
same thing using the language's rich syntax.

### Second section
The second part is about client side JavaScript, so pretty much everything in the browser. It covers the inevitable
AJAX alongside with all the new HTML5 APIs.

This section of the book is also help the developer deal with different browsers by writing pure JavaScript without
the use of a third party library like JQuery that tried to hide the difference , in the sense that it doesn't try to
hide difference between Internet Explorer and other browser

### Third and fourth section
These sections aim to be a reference, it's just exhaustive documentation about every type of objects and functions that is
organized in a coherent manner both for the core language and the client side APIs.

### Conclusion
Overall, this book dramatically changed my view about JavaScript and I know longer perceive it as a toy language to switch
images on hover but as a tool to build all kinds of applications.

There's brief coverage of server side JavaScript but I suspect that the author didn't expect it to become a thing at the
time the book was written which is a shame.

Learning JavaScript online can be daunting, there's a lot of bad information out there, there are a few exceptions like
the Mozilla Developer Network [(MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) which produces quality
documentation on both the core language and the web APIs but overall, this book is totally worth buying for reading cover
and cover and using a reference.
