## Overview

[Baconology](http://baconology.org) is a simple blog with bacon recipes built on Drupal 6. 

I'm using these modules for various reasons.

* [Views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views), [Panels and Mini panels](https://www.drupal.org/project/panels)

Helped me create a customized interface which the front page runs on, custom panels blocks contains the recipes lists.

* [CCK](https://www.drupal.org/project/cck)

Was useful in creating custom content types for recipes.

* [Scheduler](https://www.drupal.org/project/scheduler)

Create many posts at once, often months in advance and use cron to publish at the right moment.

* [Boost](https://www.drupal.org/project/boost)

Generate static content, serves as a better cache layer.

Useful for integrating 'like' capabilities

* [Twitter post](https://www.drupal.org/project/twitter)

Automatically post blog content to twitter.

* [Google analytics](https://www.drupal.org/project/google_analytics)

Helps to gather data about visitors.

* [Infinite scroll](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_infinite_scroll)

Removes pagination in favour of constant scrolling combined with ajax calls to receive more content.

* [Add to any](https://www.drupal.org/project/addtoany)

Social bookmarks, makes content easy to share on social media.

* [Ad sense content injector](https://www.drupal.org/project/adsense_injector)

Helps me serve ads based on content types.

* [Pathauto](https://www.drupal.org/project/pathauto)

Infers the path of an article from it's title without having to manually type anything.

Provides a quick to select the publishing date of scheduled content using a jQuery widget.
