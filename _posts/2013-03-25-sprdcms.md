### Overview

SprdCMS is my first attempt at creating an MVC application from scratch. 

It's made to run on the good old LAMP stack but I actually run it on the LEMP stack at the moment.

It doesn't use any known framework, just bare PHP, it has many flaws and was built
as a learning tool for [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
 and [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

I built this in conjunction of reading the book [PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice](/reviews/2012/10/18/php-objects-pattern-and-practice/) from Apress.

A demo version of SprdCMS on a live site can be found [here](http://edgclusif.com).

### Features

* Easy walk through installation with client side and server side validation.
* User friendly administrative interface.
* Create arbitrary categories and reorder articles.
* CSV batch upload of products from Spreadshirt.
* Customizable templates rendering with Twitter Bootstrap on the client side interface.
* Can work alongside any existing website, in a subdirectory or a subdomain.
* Simulated shopping cart for better integration.
