## Overview
SprdCMS is my first attempt at creating an MVC application from scratch.

It uses the good old LAMP stack but I run it on the LEMP stack.

It doesn't use any known framework, just bare PHP, it has many flaws and was built
as a learning tool for [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
 and [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

I built this in conjunction of reading the book [PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice]() from Apress.

I have written a review of this book here.

A running version of SprdCMS on a live site can be found [here](http://edgclusif.com).
