## Overview

This was probably one of my first website. I set it up to start learning about Drupal and to show the world
my undying love for bacon.

It currently runs a Drupal 6 installation, I should probably update it but I might just rebuild the whole site once
Drupal 8 is launched. I'm using the following modules.

## Installing the static site generator module

## Backing up the live site

## Generating the static content

## Pulling the plug
