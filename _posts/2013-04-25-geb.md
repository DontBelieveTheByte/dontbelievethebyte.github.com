![Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](/assets/img/reviews/geb.jpg)

This book isn't about computer science or music or cognitive science or biology or mathematics or linguistics or
philosophy or artificial intelligence or art, it's about all of these!

Not only is it brilliant, it's fascinating and cross disciplinary.

It may be a bit dated since the time it was published (especially the part about artificial intelligence where there is
a paradigm shift since then) but it is nevertheless mind expanding.

How does it relates to computer science?

Well, there's the obvious obsession with recursion as recurring topic.
You also learn how everything relates to another where similar patterns emerge where you might not expect.
The book itself is organized in the same fashion following these principles.

The most value you get out it, outside from learning about all kinds of things, is going though an exercise of
transposing knowledge and principles from one field to another which can be really useful a computer programmer.

The author makes every topics interesting with the use of stories, parables, analogies, anecdotes, images, art and crisp
explanations but you do not get all the answers right away.

The answers are something you uncover, actually, this isn't a book, this is a journey.

The book can become complicated and a bit mathematical at times. This isn't something you can read quickly without
understanding. I have also heard about another book from the same author that is more accessible (I Am a Strange Loop)
and illustrates the same concepts.

Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone curious, not only about computer science but a wide range of topics.
