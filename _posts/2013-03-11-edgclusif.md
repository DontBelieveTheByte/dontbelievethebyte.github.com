## Overview

After building my toy CMS to learn about design patterns and MVC in PHP, I had to open up a shop.

[Edgclusif.com](http://edgclusif.com/) is an online T-Shirt store implemented using the [SprdCMS](/projects/2013/03/25/sprdcms/) 
content management system for [Spreadshirt](http://www.spreadshirt.com/)
