As described by others, this series of books (a new one for each version of Drupal) is a requirement for developers. One of the keys to serving that purpose is that specific information is fairly easy to find when you need is as a reference. The dual table of contents - short and long version - and a detailed index help with that, as does the underlying structure of the book. Inclusion of the Drupal Core database schema is an example of why it is useful as a reference long after having read through it.

There is one thing that I wish it had. Since many people reading this book have used the previous versions, it would be nice if there was some indication as to what is new or changed, so that the many of us who have gone through previous editions in detail, but who will never remember all aspects of it, can know that. I know space is a premium, but maybe some icon alongside the text as an indicator of something new and something changed could serve the purpose.

The previous edition never gets to live on my bookshelf as it sits next to my workstation. As I gear up for D7, I'm sure this one has the same fate (My Drupal 5 version by now lives on the shelf).

As someone who has only had a small exposure to Drupal (v4.7) and PHP from a number of years ago, I needed a book to bring me back up to speed. This book certainly succeeds in that.

The first couple of chapters give an introduction and a sample module to ease the reader into the topic. From that point on it then goes into much more detail of the various parts of Drupal development as can be seen in the contents list in the book description. Plenty of code examples, screen shots and diagrams but not lacking in explanation either. It even goes as far as explaining why things are done a certain way (e.g. code standards) and offers website links in places where a topic can benefit from further investigation.

Although I've not read the whole book, the bits I've read are certainly taking away the worry I had about diving back into Drupal 7 and I'm now looking forward to developing my new site. Despite not being a "Pro", and only having a small amount of PHP knowledge from previous tinkerings, there is plenty in this book for me.
