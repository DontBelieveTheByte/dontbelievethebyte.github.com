## Overview

Let's get things straight from the start, PHP is moving fast and this books is a bit outdated.

If you were like me when I started reading the book, a novice programmer struggling to understand object oriented programming, it is worth your attention and money spent.

The books was written at the crossroad of PHP4 and PHP5. 

The book is divided into 3 main parts.
    
    - Objects
    - Patterns
    - Practice
    
### Objects

The relic of pre PHP5 is apparent when the author talks about passing objects using the '&' operator and uneless and unless you have the task of maintaining a legacy system, .

### Patterns

This is probably the most interesting section of the book. 

One of PHP's biggest strength is that it's easy to use with a very low barrier of entry but this also becomes one of it's greatest weakness.

Withing minutes you can create your very own spaghetti code that will be a nightmare to maintain.

This is probably why this book appealed to me so much because it proposed an easy way to get into design patterns and start thinking about
better application design using a common language.

also easy to misuse. Don't get me wrong, there are many brilliant PHP developers.
If you have never learned design patterns from other sources such as Gang of Four.

### Practice

You can safely read this if you've never delved into unit testing. The rudiments are well explained and concise. However, most of tools 
presented are outdated. Today's PHP wizards then to use Composer instead of PEAR, SVN is still in use in some places but is outshined by more modern
 tools like GIT or Mercurial.
