## Overview

I'd been programming for eight years in various languages and technologies when I read this book so I wasn't an absolute beginner; but after I read this book my coding completely changed, and I think for the better.

What impressed me most about this book was the many examples: "Uncle Bob" gave practical before and after examples of applying the principals of clean code. The examples were realistic and worthwhile: he'd take a piece of code, iteratively apply different principals and by the time he was done the code looked, well, clean, both in design and readability.

From what I've heard, what people remember most is the principal of "self-documenting code". Now I too had heard all of that before and I'd seen some terrible "self-documenting" code; however, when Martin explained it--and gave examples--it began to make sense and I've been doing it ever since. Trust me, when _he_ explains it, it makes sense.

The book goes well beyond self-documenting code. I would recommend this book for anyone who codes, but especially for someone with a couple years of, not just writing code, but also reading other people's code; often it's hard to pin down just what is so difficult and clumsy about the code we write and Martin shows us.



This book is for the serious software developer.

Add this to Fowler's Refactoring to make a great 1 - 2 punch.

While Fowler's Refactoring demonstrates techniques for moving code from one state to another, this book identifies lower level examples of what needs to be refactored (or written correctly the first time).

Read it, code for a month, and read it again.

I am part way into this book and it's a great guide with specific examples on some best practices and recommendations on how To do and Not to for small and large code projects.

The writing style of the book is very easy to follow, and does not dry out with a sprinkle of geeky humor and real-life stories. The suggestions are based on the modern programming world today, and how the life of your code may last longer and go through more hands than you may expect.

I have already started to change my coding patterns based on some of these recommendations.. and I know shifting my mindset over whatever period of time towards cleaner code, will benefit me and those to come after me.

Clean Code should be standard for all programmers/architects/engineers in any position.
