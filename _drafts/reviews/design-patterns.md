## Overview

This books is a classic that doesn't need much of an introduction. 

In this review, I will examine what are the parts that are still relevant after more than 20 years of it's publication.

The book's examples are written mostly in C++ and Smalltalk. You don't have to be a wizard in any of the those two languages as long as
you're comfortable with at least one object oriented language. 

C++ is still going strong while the often forgotten Smalltalk has principles and syntax that are close enough to Apple's Objective-C.
