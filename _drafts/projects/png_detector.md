    - You upload files to a server and want to crunch PNGs depending on the color scheme.
    - You deploy to a remote server and want to run the tool as part of a hook.
    - You want to save limited CPU resource and only compute the files as needed.
    
Here's comes a handy perl script that could help you with that. The only dependencies are pnglib and pngcrush.

```bash
conditional_png_crunch
```
