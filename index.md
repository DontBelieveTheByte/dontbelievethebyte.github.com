My name is Jean-Francois, I also enjoy all the things related to software and technology. 

One of the main reasons I decided to become a programmer is that I wanted to be in a field where 
I could continue learning new things for the rest of my life.

So far, I've dabble into a few things such as : 

-  the C programming language
-  Perl
-  PHP
-  JavaScript
-  Databases (MySQL, SQLite)
-  Java

I can probably pick up any language if I needed to.
